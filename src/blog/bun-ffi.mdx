Recently I needed to interface with a native library in a small microservice
written in JavaScript. Not counting cross-compiling native code into WebAssembly I've
dealt with FFI mainly in the Elixir/Erlang world and to some degree in Go.

There is a big distinction in my eyes between the two approaches, Go/CGo is
a compiled language so the process of doing FFI is simple, and the
implementation under the hood (seems) straightforward:

```go
package main

// #include <stdio.h>
// #include <stdlib.h>
// static void print(char *s) { printf(s); printf("\n"); }
import "C"
import "unsafe"

func main() {
  s := C.CString("uwu")
  C.print(s)
  C.free(unsafe.Pointer(s))
}
```

This roughly produces the following binary (disassembled with Binary Ninja):

```c
// Not the full disassembly output for brevity
0046a8e0  uint64_t main.main()
0046a8fa      rax_1, r1, p0 = main._Cfunc_CString(s, ~r0) // Allocates a string
0046a908      s_1, zmm15 = main._Cfunc_print(p0, r1)
0046a92a      return main.main.func1(s: s_1)

// The print function defined in the comment above import "C"
// Yes, its using the comment to define the function.
0046a7e0  uint64_t main._Cfunc_print(main._Ctype_char* p0, uint8 r1[0x0])
0046a7fc      int64_t* var_10 = &arg_8
0046a801      main._cgo_824daf35e669_Cfunc_print
0046a81a      uint64_t result
0046a81a      result, zmm15_1 = runtime.cgocall(fn: p0, arg: r1, ~r0)

004f71b0  uint64_t main._cgo_824daf35e669_Cfunc_print = 0x46a9f0 // Ref to the below func

0046a9f0  int64_t _cgo_824daf35e669_Cfunc_print(void* v)
0046a9f9      printf(format: *v)
0046aa07      return putchar(c: 0xa) __tailcall
```

When compiled it just calls the function more or less as usual.

[!note]
Just a curious aside likely caused by the garbage collector in Go is that
passing back uninitialized memory (containing what appears to be a Go pointer)
can cause runtime errors :)

> Note: the current implementation has a bug. While Go code is permitted to write nil or a C pointer (but not a Go pointer) to C memory, the current implementation may sometimes cause a runtime error if the contents of the C memory appear to be a Go pointer. Therefore, avoid passing uninitialized C memory to Go code if the Go code is going to store pointer values in it. Zero out the memory in C before passing it to Go.
[/note]

As both Elixir/Erlang and Bun (JavaScript) are both interpreted languages doing
FFI calls is more interesting. The interpreter has to do the loading and calling
during runtime! 

In the Elixir world you have two main options, *ports* which are fundamentally
just calling and communication over stdin/stdout, and *NIFs* (Native Implemented
Functions) called directly from the runtime. The former are reliable but slower,
the latter can easily cause issues in BEAM like bringing down the VM or starve the
internal scheduler.

Bun on the other hand is just kinda neat where you just load the library and do
calls:

```js
import { dlopen, FFIType, CString } from "bun:ffi";

const lib = dlopen("path/to/library.so", {
  printf: {
    args: [FFIType.cstring],
    returns: FFIType.cstring,
  },
});

const uwu = Buffer.from("uwu\n", "utf8");
lib.symbols.printf(uwu);
```

I'm sure a segfault will still crash the VM, but it's still neat!
