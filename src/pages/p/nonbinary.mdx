Hi, you might know me online as Sky and I'm non-binary. It means that I identify outside of the gender binary and that I don't identify with the gender I was assigned at birth.

## What the heck is the gender binary?
In western culture (and on the English speaking internet) gender has been broadly defined based on the apparent sex, either you are male or female, a man or a woman, and either you use "he" or "she" to describe people. Sure it works for a lot of people, but far from everyone. Some languages and societies capture this and avoid gendered language or have vocabulary outside of the gender binary.


## What is non-binary then?
The short answer, it's someone who doesn't neatly fit into one of the categories above, or someone who blends them together, or someone who doesn't identify with any gender at all.

The longer answer (using a metaphor that I really like!) is to describe it based on the IEEE754 floating point standard. Most people will identify either as a "woman" or a "man". Some will identify as being somewhere on the axis in-between, and since it's floating point it can be anywhere, sometimes closer to one or the other. Then there will be some that just are outside of that, which the standard also allows for! I also want to add that the place or range where someone is isn't fixed and can sometimes change over time.


## What does it all mean for me?
Mainly for me it means that I'm nowadays am my authentic self and that my gender identity and my gender expression align. It also means that I ask people to respect who I am the same as they respect anyone else. In practice that's me just asking for a couple small things that you already do for everyone else. 

### Pronouns
<aside>In my native language, Swedish, we haven't even had any generally recognized pronouns outside of the gender binary for a long time. It really sucks(ed), and people still often use exclusionary language like "he/she did that". It's moving in the right direction though[^isof].</aside>

Pronouns are the words that you use when referring to someone without using their name. In English that's just using singular they/them, in Swedish it's "hen".

A couple examples:
* Is that Sky? Yea I've met <Rainbow>*them*</Rainbow> before.
* Sky was awake all night as usual, <Rainbow>*they*</Rainbow> are probably super tired.

### Name
One part is also that I ask people to use my name, even if you might have known me by the name I was given by my parents when I was born. They of course didn't know who I was at the time (and couldn't really ask!) so I was given a traditionally gendered name.

### Language
This is just something everyone should do in general, and means a lot for me and I think I'm safe to assume that it does for most non-binary people! Phrases like "ladies and gents" exclude those that aren't "ladies" or "gents". Alternatively you could use phrases like "salutations everyone" or just simply "hello everyone". 


## Why is it important?
It's simple - *out of <Rainbow>respect</Rainbow>*. 

The same way you don't call Alice Eve or Steve, and apologize if you slip up. It's okay to make mistakes, we all do, the effort is what counts. Even if you subscribed to the attempt at dragging this into politics[^eff], you do you, as long as you show others respect and decency.


## Wrap up
To wrap things up, non-binary identity is broad and encompasses many different gender expressions outside of the traditional male and female identities. I wrote this to try and explain (some of) my experience. It's unique but at the same time it's one out of many. To those that took the time to read a bit about me, I'm grateful and I want to encourage you to also ask others with gender non-conforming identities about what it means for them.

And hey! Shoot over any questions you have, I super appreciate them \<3

[^isof]: For example, the government authority *Institutet för språk och folkminnen* (Institute for Language and Folklore) explicitly tells people to "*Respect individuals choice of pronouns - if you know that the person prefers certain pronouns you should use them, it can be he, she, they, or something else.*" [Source (in Swedish)](https://www.isof.se/stod-och-sprakrad/spraktjanster/klarsprakshjalpen/skriv-klarsprak/tank-pa-dina-lasare/fordjupning-tank-pa-dina-lasare/anvand-inkluderande-sprak)
