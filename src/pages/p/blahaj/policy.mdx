# Blåhaj Group Governance

**_Last updated: {updated}_**

Blåhaj Group is an inclusive community primarily centred around World of
Warcraft. We strive to lead by example, both for our members and the wider
community. This document outlines the important principles that guide us and
setting up a formal framework for how the community is run, and what we expect from our members.

## Governing Structure

The main principle is that Blåhaj Group is a flat organization[^1]. Decisions
are made bottom-up, that is, members decide the direction of the community. To
ensure that community values are upheld select members are part of Blåhaj Human
Resources. These individuals have been entrusted to facilitate the day to day
running of the community, such as moderating social channels.

## Update History

    This is in sharp contrast to how many World of Warcraft guilds and wider
    communities are run. There is no single leader (e.g. guild master) nor an
    officer organization as a decision body.
